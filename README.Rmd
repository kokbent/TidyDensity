The goal of TidyDensity is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of TidyDensity from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("TidyDensity")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/TidyDensity")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TidyDensity)

tn <- tidy_normal(.n = 100, .num_sims = 30)
head(tn)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot_density}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

tn_mean <- tn %>%
  summarise(grp_mean = mean(y, na.rm = TRUE))

p1 <- tn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y, group = sim_number, color = sim_number)) +
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(data = tn_mean, aes(xintercept = grp_mean),
             linetype ="dashed", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(
    title = "Density Distribution", 
    subtitle = paste0(
      "Simulations: ", attributes(tn)$.num_sims, 
      " - mu: ", attributes(tn)$.mean, 
      " - sd: ", attributes(tn)$.sd, 
      " - Random Points: ", attributes(tn)$.n
    ),
    color = "Simulation",
    x = "x",
    y = "Density"
  )

p1
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
